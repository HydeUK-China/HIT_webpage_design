          </p>
          <h4>How We Use Your Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            We will hold, use and disclose your personal information, for our legitimate business
            purposes including:
          </p>
          <ul>

          </ul>
          <p>
            We may process, in accordance with local regulations, certain sensitive personal data (known as special
            category data in GDPR) where you include it in information you send to us e.g.

            We have processes in place to limit our use and disclosure of such sensitive data other than where permitted

          <p><strong>The Legal Basis For Processing Your Personal Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            Under GDPR, the main grounds that we rely upon in order to process personal information of users and
            business partners are the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Necessary for entering into, or performing, a contract</b> – in order to perform obligations that we
              undertake in providing a
              service to you, or in order to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with us,
              it will be necessary for us to process your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Necessary for compliance with a legal obligation</b> – we are subject to certain legal requirements
              which may require us to process your personal data. We may also be obliged by law to disclose your
              personal data to a regulatory body or law enforcement agency;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests -</b> either we, or a third party, will need to
              process your personal data for
              the purposes of our (or a third party's) legitimate interests, provided we have established that those
              interests are not overridden by your
              rights and freedoms, including your right to have your personal data protected. Our legitimate interests
              include responding to requests and
              enquiries from you or a third party, optimising our website and customer experience, informing you about
              our products and services and ensuring
              that our operations are conducted in an appropriate and efficient manner;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Consent</b> – in some circumstances, we may ask for your consent to process your personal data in a
              particular way.
              Particularly in regard to information about your research project.
            </li>

            approved safeguards are in place.
